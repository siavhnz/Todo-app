## My process
  - Identify Components and structure App
  - Working on Mobile design based on `design` folder - 375px
    - Install preflight.css, install fonts, set Title & favicon , working on resolution >= 375px
  - Working on Todo functionality
    - add & delete item, mark as complete, clear completed item, filter by active & complete state
  - Working on Light and Dark mode
  - Working on Desktop design on `design` folder - 1440px
  - Improving Components and app data flow by useContext
  - Adding Drag & Drop to reorder items and animation to components with framer-motion

### Built with
  - React
  - Framer-motion
  - Css Module
  - Flex, Grid, Custom variable
  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - Mobile first workflow


### What I learned

In this project I learned how work on: 
  - Dark & light mode
  - Manage state usign useReducer
  - Flowing data using useContext
  - Drag & drop using framer-motion

### Continued development

I think I must work on more logical project like this one to get more comfortable 
with handling larger project
